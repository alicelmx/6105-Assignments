    "## ML Data Cleaning and Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use a dataset for predictive learning and check the quality of the data and determine which features are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the data types? (Only numeric and categorical)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the likely distributions of the numeric variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which independent variables are useful to predict a target (dependent variable)? (Use at least three methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which independent variables have missing data? How much? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Do the training and test sets have the same data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which predictor variables are the most important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do the ranges of the predictor variables make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the distributions of the predictor variables?   \n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove outliers and keep outliers (does if have an effect of the final predictive model)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove 1%, 5%, and 10% of your data randomly and impute the values back using at least 3 imputation methods. How well did the methods recover the missing values?  That is remove some data, check the % error on residuals for numeric data and check for bias and variance of the error.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. ✅ Public dataset (5 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick a public dataset that can be used for Regression or Classification. You MUST get approval for your dataset from the TAs.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What code is yours and what have you adapted? (5 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "You must explain what code you wrote and what you have done that is different. Failure to cite ANY code will result in a zero for this section.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Did I explain my code clearly? (15 Points) Your code review score will be scaled to a range of 0 to 10 and be used for this score.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Did I explain my licensing clearly? (5 Points) Failure to cite a clear license will result in a zero for this section.\n",
